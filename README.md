# React + Vite

# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a simple React application that allows users to search for weather information based on city names. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

# Features

Users can enter a city name in the search bar and click the search icon to retrieve weather information for that city.
The application displays the current weather temperature, location, humidity, and wind speed.
Error handling is implemented to alert the user if they attempt to search without entering a city name.
